# To Do

## Maybe Not

* One could offer an alternative definition of an iteration space
  as a set of finite sequences of iteration events (`Yield` or `Done`),
  where a `Done` event can never be followed by any event.

* One could offer a variant of iteration spaces that allows silent steps
  (`Skip`) in the style of the *stream fusion* paper. This would
  correspond to allowing silent transitions in automata.
